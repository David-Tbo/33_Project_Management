    "# DETAILED PRESENTATION  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we will see how to create and manage Python environments using Conda, virtualenv, and without virtualenv.  \n",
    "Python environments allow you to create isolated workspaces for Python projects, making it easier to manage dependencies and reproduce results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda\n",
    "========\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is a package and environment manager for Python. It allows you to create isolated environments with specific versions of Python and libraries installed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda allows you to easily create exportable work environments in the form of a .yml file.  \n",
    "An environment is a parameterization of the work ecosystem that can be exported to other machines in order to reproduce the processing performed without having to install a too complex environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, two environment management systems exist: virtual-env and Anaconda environments.  \n",
    "An environment in Anaconda is summarized in a .yml file that brings together all the necessary information for the operation of your programs:  \n",
    "- the version of Python, \n",
    "- the packages and \n",
    "- their dependancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default environment in Anaconda is the root environment (base) in which all packages available on your machine are accessible from your code.  \n",
    "However, it is recommended to set up an environment for each project in which you will only install the packages you need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a new Conda environment  \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new Conda environment, open a terminal and type the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name myenv`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new environment named \"myenv\" in the Conda folder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation of the Conda environnement  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the environment is created, you can activate it using the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate myenv` \n",
    "\n",
    "This command activates the \"myenv\" environment, which means that any packages you install or use will be isolated to this environment.  \n",
    "To deactivate the environment and return to the root environment, use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda deactivate` \n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages in the Conda environment, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install package_name` \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use pip to install packages that are not available in Conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a Conda environment, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda remove --name myenv --all` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning an existing Conda environment can be useful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cloning means that the new environment will have the same package structure, the same version of Python, and the same environment variables as the source environment.  \n",
    "To clone the environment \"myenv\" into a new environment named \"myclone\", you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name myclone --clone myenv` \n",
    "\n",
    "Replicating an environment is more complex than cloning, but it allows you to customize the new environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Method 1: replication of package versions only  \n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate the packages without specifying versions or a specific operating system, you can use a YAML file (.yml).  \n",
    "Create a .yml file by exporting the existing environment to this file:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env export > environment.yml` \n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the YAML file to customize the new environment.  \n",
    "For example, add or remove packages, modify package versions or environment variables.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Create and load the new environment from the YAML file:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -f environment.yml`  \n",
    "Method 2: identical replication (package versions + OS versions)\n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate your environment identically (package versions on the same operating system), you can use a specification file that you will retrieve using:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -f environment.yml` \n",
    "\n",
    "You can export this environment to a new machine, but it must have the same operating system:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name MyEnvironment --file spec-file.txt` \n",
    "\n",
    "You can then load the scripts developed on your environment on the other machine without risk of version compatibility problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtualenv  \n",
    "=============  \n",
    "\n",
    "Virtualenv is a tool for creating virtual environments for Python. It allows you to create isolated environments with specific versions of Python and libraries installed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To install virtualenv, you can use pip, the Python package manager:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install virtualenv` \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment with virtualenv, open a terminal and type the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv myenv`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new virtual environment named \"myenv\" in the current directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the virtual environment, you must run the following command in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux and Mac:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`source myenv/bin/activate`  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`myenv\\Scripts\\activate`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual environment is activated, the name of the environment will be displayed at the command prompt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages in the virtual environment, you can use pip. For example, to install NumPy, type the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install numpy`  \n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`deactivate`   \n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a virtual environment, you can simply delete the virtual environment directory.  \n",
    "For example, to delete the virtual environment \"myenv\", type the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux and Mac:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`rm -rf myenv`  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`rmdir /S myenv`  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Python  \n",
    "=================  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to create Python environments without using virtualenv, using Python's built-in features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment without virtualenv, you can use the venv module of Python. Open a terminal and type the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`python3 -m venv myenv`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new virtual environment named \"myenv\" in the current directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the virtual environment, you must run the following command in a terminal:  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux and Mac:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`source myenv/bin/activate`  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`myenv\\Scripts\\activate`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual environment is activated, the name of the environment will be displayed at the command prompt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages in the virtual environment, you can use pip. For example, to install NumPy, type the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install numpy`   \n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`deactivate`   \n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a virtual environment, you can simply delete the virtual environment directory.  \n",
    "For example, to delete the virtual environment \"myenv\", type the following command:  \n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux and Mac:\n",
    "\n",
    "`rm -rf myenv`   \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`rmdir /S myenv`   \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we have seen how to create and manage Python environments with Conda, virtualenv, and without virtualenv.  \n",
    "Python environments allow you to create isolated workspaces for Python projects, making it easier to manage dependencies and reproduce results.  \n",
    "By using virtual environments, you can install the packages you need for a specific project without affecting other projects or the system environment.\n"
